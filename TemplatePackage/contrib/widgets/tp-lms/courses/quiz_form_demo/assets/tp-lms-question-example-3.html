  <h3>About this Question:</h3>
  <div>
      <p>This is an example of a "Correct Required" question, which means you must select a correct answer to proceed, and will be allowed to retry until you have done so.</p>
      <p>Again, as you would expect, the "Next" button does not show unless you have answered correctly or previously completed this question.  However, once you pick an answer, it will save, and lock the option controls, and allow you to continue.</p>
      <p>The first time you answer, the the quiz system hides the question &amp; options and then shows you the appropriate response. On subsequent visits to this page however (via the back button or during a Review) the quiz system will show the question, options (which will be locked) with your choice selected, and the response to your chosen answer.</p>
