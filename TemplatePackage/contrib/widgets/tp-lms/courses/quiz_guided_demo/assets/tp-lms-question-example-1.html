  <h3>About this Question:</h3>
  <div>
    <p>This is an example of a question which is purely optional. </p>
    <p>Notice the "Next" button shows even if we have not previously visited or completed this question.  However, once you pick an answer, it will save and lock the option controls</p>
    <p>Since this question is optional, we are considering it more of an interactive learning widget, so the quiz system will show you the appropriate response for each selected answer and will not hide the question or options.</p>
