    In this example, we are decided that we needed a bit more
    flexibility than loading in simple text, so I have gone ahead
    and made an html file and placed the content you currently
    see in it. I then set the 'includePath' property to the location
    of this file and... viola!
    <img src="{{assetsPath}}/images/research.jpg" alt="placeholder image" style="float:right;">
  </p>
  <p>This method allows developers to use the TPLMS while
  still having ultimate control over the vast majority of the user
  experience.</p>

  <p>Let's say for example that you want to load in a video. No
  problem, just include standard template package markup and
  you'll get a video like this:</p>

  <div class="youtube">
    <iframe width="560" height="320" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iLqTS8vn8Eo?cc_load_policy=1&wmode=opaque" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
    <p><a>View Transcript [PDF - 123 KB]</a></p>
    <noscript>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iLqTS8vn8Eo?cc_load_policy=1" target="_blank">Demo Video</a>
    </noscript>
  </div>

<p>Its as simple as that, and TemplatePackage compliant HTML can be implemented in this system with little or no adjustment.</p>
